# Wikipedia Viewer

I created this Wikipedia Viewer as part of the Freecodecamp Curriculum. 

* You can get a random Wikipedia article by clicking on the Random-Article-Link.
* Or you can search for articles and then get re-directed to your chosen article on Wikipedia

Made with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript and a bit of jQuery to get the JSON data.
